lavapdu (0.0.4-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  The lavapdu-daemon configuration has changed.
  Old versions of lavapdu-runner tried to guess the
  type of interface on the specified PDU but this was
  unreliable.
  This version requires that the driver for your PDU is
  specified in the /etc/lavapdu/lavapdu.conf file. Examples
  are given but you will need to edit this file to specify
  the PDU address (hostname or IP address) and the driver
  to use for that PDU.
  Check the lavapdu-runner logs to ensure that the driver
  specified works for your PDU and restart the lavapdu-runner
  when changing the configuration file.
